# Welcome to my web development blog!

This GitHub repository serves as a storage location for all of the code, content, and resources that power my personal blog site.

Here, you will find a variety of files and directories that make up the backbone of my blog, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, as well as images, blog posts, and other supporting materials.

# Dev setup

This project is powered by React and Vite. Installing dependencies and running the `dev` script is all you need:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:5173/
